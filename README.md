## Why making events?

TBC.—

## Before

#### The basics

##### Format & Content

  - Find a suitable format for your event: keynotes, roundtables, hands-on, working groups…
  - Lookup for interesting content using [Call for Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_for_papers).
  - It might be good to create a narrative: using the right sequence of talks to tell a story.

##### Date

  - Think in your main target availability and time-constraints.
  - Avoid clashing with similar/big events.


##### Venue

  - Find a suitable space for your activity.
  - Take “no-show” into account.
  - Changing the venue can improve diversity!


#### Advertisement

##### Website

  - For smaller events, you don't need a fiull website.
  - Have clear indications about what will happen (display your agenda).
  - Be clear about the price, location and date.

##### PR, Social Networks, Mailing

  - Maintain your social networks / mailing channels.
  - Reach out to people that doesn’t follow you yet & seek for diversity.
  - Produce a press release (bigger events).

##### Tracking

 - Track the impact of your social channels.

#### Sponsors

Do you need sponsors? Most of the times, if you have a middle size community (50 members) and there is interest in paying plane tickets for a speaker (perhaps around 250€ within Europe), the math talks by itself: your best sponsor is your audience. However, bigger events including several rations of food, professional media coverage and nice event dressing, might need an special plan for sponsors.

##### Offer clear information about your event

  - If your website displays already all the information, that should be enough.
  - In any case, your potential sponsor might appreciate summarized information about:
    - Agenda (and) Speakers.
    - Expected attendees.
    - Other partners.

##### Have a meaningful value proposition

  - Research about the value for your sponsor: offering only marketing is not (very) interesting.

#### Get help from others

Organizing an event is a great excersise for training your multi-disciplinar teamwork abilities, getting help from others doesn't only make your life easier, but also enhances diversity and increases the value of your proposal and the overal experience.
